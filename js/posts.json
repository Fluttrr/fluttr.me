            "content": "i wonder what i want from life. for most of my life i thought i lived for connecting with others, for the type of connection i was craving. recently ive felt other motivations. living just for the sake of living, of creating, of experiencing new things and enjoying the way life unfolds itself. but its conflicting. because sometimes the former shines through and it makes me doubt whether the latter really is enough. and life just cant always be exciting and eventful. sadly, it feel like the two options are almost incompatible. you cant have stability and commitment as well as spontaniety and novelty. or maybe you can. but i totally tend to just settle down and become complacent with the way things are and not changing anything.\nmaybe im just too afraid to commit, to make the same mistakes ive made in the past. there is something beautiful about both ways of living and i feel like it would be cool to commit to something if i felt confident about it. maybe theres no point in worrying about all this to begin with.. its just a choice id have to make whenever i actually have the choice. but until then its still weird to think about. wish life was just a little easier.. or maybe it is and im just making it hard for myself. this year has already been so eventful and its not even half way done, so i think ive done a decent job so far. and im sure ill make the best of whatever comes. but i wont settle on any particular way of thinking for now, and ill see where life takes me. i think thats the best approach."

            "title": "making stuff sucks",
            "content": "making art is hard. i know this feeling of opening up fl studio and only making complete unusable garbage all to well. following some weird idea without it going anywhere. and yet, it still always makes me feel as useless and incapable as it did when i started making music. it makes me feel like im incapable of making anything, like i finally lost it, like ill never be able to make something good again. and that feeling sucks so much. as always, i will come back another day when i feel more into it, and i will make something i am proud of again. but until that day my mind is tainted by this frustrating, sad experience that is so annoyingly irrational.\nive also felt such a strong urge to branch out into other genres and stuff. i wanna make the stuff ive been enjoying so much lately, but it sucks. its hard to try out new things. when i first started making music, everything i made was utter useless garbage that nobody would ever wanna listen to. and that felt bad enough to the point where i just stopped making music for years. im still not sure anybody would actually listen to any of the stuff i make, but at least i can find some value in it. but when trying out new things, its just as hard again. but i suppose its worth it. it was worth sticking around back then and its just a matter of trusting the process. maybe i need to do that again... or maybe part of the problem is doing this all alone. its kinda sad to think ive only ever done this stuff completely alone. i wouldnt even know how to involve anyone else in the process, but i think that would be nice. idk... its all weird. and complicated. all i know is that this feeling sucks. but i know that in a few days or weeks, i will start up fl studio again, and maybe that time will go better. and maybe one day ill finally genuinely make something that i can be proud of, something that i want to make. one day."

            "content": "change is scary. even getting used to shitty situations is often more comfortable than confronting myself with any chance of things changing. but obviously that can't be good for you.. or maybe it is. im not sure. things are confusing!! but taking a step feels nice. not knowing whether its the right or wrong direction is weird, but at the very least you're going somewhere, not stuck in the same safe space. good things can only come from change and daring to leave that place of comfort. or maybe it's not about the good things at all. maybe its just about finally not standing still anymore. maybe change is what makes life good. who knows. im confused. i always will be!! but thats okay. i dont need to understand. but im not gonna stand still, ill take things into my own hands and deal with the consequences. because, at the very least, i know im trying and i know im alive. that has value in itself."

            "content": "i guess this is my first post here lol.. hi!! whoever may read this. im making this whole addition to my website along with the music part because i got motivated by a person i will refer to with the codename toolf (whoever that may be), but ive been meaning to do this stuff for a while, especially the blog part. i worked on the music part for quite a few hours and then spit out this blog feature in like 30 mins... but it was fun! i havent really done any sort of coding in a while. even though i study computer science. how sad. its also worrying how little i actually did myself.. almost everything was just copying code. i understood almost all of it but like, i totally couldnt write it from scratch without taking 100x longer looking everything up. definitely giving me a bit of impostor syndrome, but.. whatever. im sure its fine!!\nthe features i worked on are far from perfect (didnt care to implement the mute button for the volume control), and the whole input prompt is causing some scrolling issues on mobile, but at least it works.. i think ill embrace that this website is more of a desktop experience and just try to make sure mobile at least works.\nreleasing thoughts like this is weird. who am i talking to? who am i thinking will read this? will any of the people who i think will read it actually read it? what would they think? is this a kind of diary? isnt the whole point of diaries that theyre private and you can write whatever in them? am i supposed to be fully honest and open here? where is the line?\nidk. so many questions. but thats okay!! this is just a fun little place i can put random stuff on. and if its embarassing or dumb, ill delete it!! but hopefully not. thanks to whoever might have read this. please send me cute cat gifs. and have a good day pls!!"
