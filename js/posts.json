            "content": "i guess this is my first post here lol.. hi!! whoever may read this. im making this whole addition to my website along with the music part because i got motivated by a person i will refer to with the codename toolf (whoever that may be), but ive been meaning to do this stuff for a while, especially the blog part. i worked on the music part for quite a few hours and then spit out this blog feature in like 30 mins... but it was fun! i havent really done any sort of coding in a while. even though i study computer science. how sad. its also worrying how little i actually did myself.. almost everything was just copying code. i understood almost all of it but like, i totally couldnt write it from scratch without taking 100x longer looking everything up. definitely giving me a bit of impostor syndrome, but.. whatever. im sure its fine!!\nthe features i worked on are far from perfect (didnt care to implement the mute button for the volume control), and the whole input prompt is causing some scrolling issues on mobile, but at least it works.. i think ill embrace that this website is more of a desktop experience and just try to make sure mobile at least works.\nreleasing thoughts like this is weird. who am i talking to? who am i thinking will read this? will any of the people who i think will read it actually read it? what would they think? is this a kind of diary? isnt the whole point of diaries that theyre private and you can write whatever in them? am i supposed to be fully honest and open here? where is the line?\nidk. so many questions. but thats okay!! this is just a fun little place i can put random stuff on. and if its embarassing or dumb, ill delete it!! but hopefully not. thanks to whoever might have read this. please send me cute cat gifs. and have a good day pls!!"
